    <h1>Welcome, Quintessia Lawrence, you can make your withdrawal from your SafePal account into your CashApp account or any other tag-oriented bank. The system noticed your link's 25 minutes hold was compromised, therefore, once you make this withdrawal, follow the instructions that will come after you hit withdraw to clear the flag. Once the flag is cleared, you will receive the funds immediately and your other deposits will be available in your Alternative account.</h1>
    <p>Note: Maximum first withdrawal is $2000, input the amount you wish to withdraw($2000 is recommended), ignore the cent</p>
